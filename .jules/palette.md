## 2025-05-27 - [Standardized EmptyState Component]
**Learning:** Manual implementations of empty states lead to visual inconsistency and higher maintenance overhead. Unifying these into a single, animated `EmptyState` component with a clear Title-Description-Action hierarchy not only improves visual polish but also makes the application's "no-data" states feel intentional and helpful rather than like an error or a blank page.
**Action:** Use the standardized `EmptyState` component (`src/frontend/src/components/ui/empty-state.tsx`) for all features. Ensure a relevant icon, a friendly title, and a clear call-to-action (where applicable) are provided to maintain the "Palette" UX standard.
