## 2025-05-15 - Accessibility and Feedback Improvements
**Learning:** In a shadcn/ui-based project, blocking `alert()` calls disrupt the flow. Using `sonner` toasts provides a more integrated and pleasant experience. Also, "invisible" hover-only actions in cards are a common accessibility barrier that can be easily fixed with `group-focus-within`.
**Action:** Always check for `alert()` calls and hover-only action containers to improve accessibility and feedback.
