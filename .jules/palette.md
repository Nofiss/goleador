## 2025-05-27 - [Standardized EmptyState Component]
**Learning:** Manual implementations of empty states lead to visual inconsistency and higher maintenance overhead. Unifying these into a single, animated `EmptyState` component with a clear Title-Description-Action hierarchy not only improves visual polish but also makes the application's "no-data" states feel intentional and helpful rather than like an error or a blank page.
**Action:** Use the standardized `EmptyState` component (`src/frontend/src/components/ui/empty-state.tsx`) for all features. Ensure a relevant icon, a friendly title, and a clear call-to-action (where applicable) are provided to maintain the "Palette" UX standard.

## 2025-05-28 - [Interactive Feedback & Global Consistency]
**Learning:** Micro-interactions (like a subtle rotation on a swap button) combined with global visual consistency (standardized empty states) significantly increase the perceived quality of the application. Standardizing empty states across different views (Matches, Standings, Players) makes the app feel cohesive, while small animations provide immediate, delightful feedback that makes the interface feel alive.
**Action:** Always look for opportunities to replace manual "no-data" states with the `EmptyState` component. When adding icon-only buttons, include a native `title` for tooltips and consider a simple `framer-motion` animation for hover/active states.
